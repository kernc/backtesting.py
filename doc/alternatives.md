Alternatives
------------
The thing with backtesting is, unless you dug into the dirty details yourself,
you can't rely on execution correctness, and you risk losing your house.
In addition, everyone has their own preconveived ideas about how a mechanical
trading strategy should be conducted, so everyone (and their brother)
just rolls their own backtesting frameworks.
